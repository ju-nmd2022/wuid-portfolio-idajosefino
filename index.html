    <h3 class="header3">About me</h3>
    <p class="texthead3">My name is Ida Olsson and I am a 27 year old from Mariestad, Sweden. As a person I am outgoing and social, kind, a good friend and listener.<br>
       I grew up on the Isle of Thor with my parents and two siblings. I have a college degree in Health Science, I am a certified personal trainer<br>
       and health coach. I am a cat person, master sonderer and an oldest sibling in a nutshell. Forever too hard on myself <br>
       but always ready to go to battle for others.

    <h3>Why I am studying NMD</h3>
    <p class="multi-column">
        I have always loved creating things. Painting, taking pictures, writing... Since I was very young I have been the one with fantasy and
        creativity to spare. But being raised in a family of doctors and nurses, this has always made me feel a bit different. I didn't pursue 
        this and instead tried to fit in by choosing to study and work in the health field. I realized pretty quickly that even though I found 
        it interesting, the subject didn't give me much else. I kept working on my small business where I was selling digital design on the side, 
        creating it for fun, and the customers kept giving me amazing reviews and kept telling me that I have the eye for design. One day in March
        of 2022 I turned to my family and asked if they think I should apply for university again, but this time majoring in digital design. They
        all told me what I needed to hear. That it made all the sense in the world. I never thought they thought that, but with their support and
        a bit of courage, I applied and got in. I know now that I want to become a graphic designer. I want to work with companies and branding, 
        copywriting and keep on expanding my own small business selling digital products. I believe NMD will help me in reaching these dreams.</p>

        <p><h3>My Hobbies</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reading</strong></li>
        <p>I am an avid reader, consuming about 60 books a year like it's sugary oxygen. I have not always enjoyed books though. It started when<br> 
        I was studying at university the first time around back in 2016. It's mostly audiobooks I consume but I find that escaping reality for a while<br> 
        can feel very calming and liberating. I'm a mood reader but when it comes to genres I prefer reading fantasy and psychological thrillers.<br>
        <br><em>Currently reading: Fire and Blood by George R.R Martin</em>
    </p><br>
        <li><strong>Photography</strong></li>
        <p>I take pictures every single day. I like to document my life as well as capture moments that lasts. I much prefer taking pictures of<br>
        people when they are not ready. Catching humans just being human is the most beautiful thing. I also enjoy sunset photography.</p>
    <br>
        <li><strong>Designing</strong></li>
        <p>I have a small business on the side designing icons, Notion templates and other designs for digital use. Since 2020 when I opened my<br>
        online store on etsy I have gained much more traffic than I thought I would. This is what also kickstarted the idea of studying digital design<br>
        on university level. To increase the knowledge and get a more stable ground to work on to improve my products I sell further and grow my business.
