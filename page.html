<p class="text">
    My family lives on the Isle of Thor, the biggest Island in Vänern. My grandmother and grandfather grew up here, as did their grandmothers and grandfathers before. It’s a place we love and are very proud to be living at. Both of my parents are highly interested in gardening and carpeting. My mother has her own space in our big garden where she grows anything and everything you can eat. From potatoes to tomatoes and even melons. Grapes were the latest thing both her and dad wanted to try out. 
    My mom grew the seeds and took incredible care of the plant, as well as harvested it when it was ready. My dad, who loves beer and wine and has his own brewery, did the rest. The result was very simple but incredible wine. They were both very proud of their first try at it, and I therefore wanted to cheer them on further and contribute. 
    That is how this wine label was inspired by. It’s named after my mother, Veronica, and the picture on the label is an edited photograph of her in her greenhouse.</p>
